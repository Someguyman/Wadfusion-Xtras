/*
	You're a cyberdemon, one of hells most biggest, baddest,
	and toughest around. Equipt with nothing but a rocket
	launcher and a taste for violence, your sheer presents 
	brings lesser demons to their knee's. Because of this,
	you were fit to spear-head the council that ruled the
	underworld; the Cabal.
	
	Just over a year ago, a single mortal, a marine from
	the U.A.C mars division, single handedly brought a cold end
	to the hell on earth operation and had slain the bio weapon 
	planned to convert earth to hell's needs; the Icon of Sin.
	
	With the operation a failure, you were lambasted by the
	dark lords above and even the lesser demons started to
	fear you less. Some even gaining sinister smiles just
	glancing at you. Then one day, in what felt like an hour, 
	the hoards you once ruled all jumped at you at once.
	Powerless against an army of traitors, you are torn
	apart limb from limb and blackout. 
	
	But you wished that how it ended, as you wake
	up to find yourself the victim of the upmost demonic
	humiliation: you've been reduced to a mere mortal!
	With nothing but puny glock and your bare ass, all you
	can feel is a smoldering heat and demonic chanting in the 
	distance as you look though the metal bars of the 
	red prison you're in.
	
	You hear from an imp gaurd that you'll be taken to a 
	demonic arena soon. But not to fight anyone to try 
	and recalim even a scarp dignity, but be nothing 
	more then  a laughing stock before being completely 
	violated and dismembered!
	
	Swearing revenge, You'll make the Cabal pay for this.
	You kill the lowley gaurd mocking your appearence
	and make haste out of the dungeon of the arena and 
	into the sea of blood surrounding the place. You
	eventually find youself in front

/*
You once were the biggest and baddest Cyber-demon to
rule hell and you spear-headed the council that 
governed the underworld; "the Cabal". Betrayed by the
other members you find yourself not only dismantled, 
but also a victim of the utmost demonic humiliation:
You've been morphed into a human! Of course you're
out for revenge and have to kick the other members of 
the Cabal's butts one by one.
			
"Bloodsea Keep" is the home of your past advisor; 
Veavitdpoh (Very Evil Arch-Vile In The Deepest Parts 
Of Hell). Veavitdpoh is an old-school demon that 
believes in the rip-out-heart-routine and so shuns 
all use of technology and mechanical weaponry. His 
cult following has grown the last century but still 
amounts to little. Unless you face them alone of 
course...

After being dumped into the endless "Sea of Blood" 
following your humiliating transformation into a 
human you swim for an eternity before you finally 
bump your head against the pier of the keep. 
Digging your feet into the mud of human remains your 
hand brushes by an old blood-soaked shotgun, the 
previous owner's severed hand still attached to it. 
All who enter "Bloodsea Keep" with such items fall
victim to your former advisor's favourite past-time:
Torture. Any "heretics" still alive inside the keep  
should be homicidal maniacs at best.
"That's OK" you think, "maybe they brought some more 
ammo for the shotgun", before cocking the rusty 
pump-action, causing an eyeball to fly out of the 
cartridge...

"Just having escaped the Sea of Blood you have sought
out a derelict building in the search for arms &
equipment. Unfortunately the station isn't as 
abandoned as you thought."

"You have come upon one of the Cabal's blood-depoes. 
An important element in any powerful black magic is 
huge amounts of blood. Emptying the depoe's tanks 
into the nearby river you will have struck your first 
blow against the Cabal."

In Mephisto's Maosoleum you have reached the grave of
an old friend and mentor: "Mephisto". Yeah old Lucy
was a tough bastard. But then there was that incident 
with the earthling marine which lost him a lot of
credit in the hard-core parts of Hell. So you had to 
kick him off the throne of course. His immortal
spirit was kept as a member of the Cabal though and 
so he was in on the betrayal against you. Time to 
enter his tomb and lay the old man down to rest 
for good...

"The Cabal has started striking back at you. That 
last gateway should have taken you... well somewhere 
else. Not to an arena where thousands of humans have 
lost their souls to hungry demons. As you get ready
for the first wave of hellspawned gladiators you
swear to blast the emperor's thumbs off before he can
even think about turning them down on you..."

When the "Express Elevator to Hell" starts descending 
the renegade Cabal has begun to realize you might be 
a threat to them, human or not. Half way down the 
shaft that should have taken you to the deepest pits 
of Hell, the lift first slows down before it jerks to 
a halt. Ambush! Survive the initial onslaught and 
find a gateway out of the now sealed elevator. Tough, 
but that's the way you like it...

"You find yourself in the remains of an old forttress                  
after ascending a lift shaft from the mines where you
were trapped. Signs of unlife is evident but from 
what you know of this place it should pose no great 
threat to you. It used to be the centre of a 
Cacodemon empire that perished some 665 yeaes ago. 
Oh, by the way, it's new years eve..."

In "Black Tower" you're nearing the end of your
journey. You and Chagrin, the ruler of the Black
Tower, came off the same conveyor belt as newly 
assembled cyber-demons a few thousand years back. 
"Oil runs thicker than blood" the two of you used to 
say. Demons don't come much closer to friendship than 
what you and Chagrin shared. Well now your buddy 
rules the hordes of hell previously under your 
command and have left you for dead. Your task is 
simple: Enter the dreaded Black Tower, the nucleus of 
black magic and the occult in all of Hell, get to 
its highest floor and slay Chagrin. Then there is the 
getting back out as well...

"The Image of Evil is a humongous temple created 
to the honour of the first Demon to slay an angel;
Lithlaar. In it you will find the Cybo that now is
known as the lord of Hell and his two Soulguards."
