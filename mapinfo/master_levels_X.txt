// Misc maps that aren't part of a particular set.

//Includes the fallowing: 

//Tom Mustains master level submssions (Both accepted and rejected, inclusing those that made it into TNT),
//Tim Wilitz submissions plus an extra promotional wad he designed to advertise kick soda called "Kick Attack",
//And fixed up versions of the beta Doom 64 maps so they're actually beatable. 

//Might remove later once those that come with the Doom 64 for doom 2 esche lost levels demakes come out.
//Can always make it toggleable like the two tnt maps in here.
